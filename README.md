**Due to the lack of support and Zeplin's internal policies, we stopped working on Zeplin iOS application. More information can be found through https://twitter.com/yagiznizipli/status/1238143337661640706**


So, apparently instead of replying to our emails Zeplin decided with promoting non-open sourced version of zeplin client (https://blog.zeplin.io/making-zeplin-mobile-with-zeplin-api-2db73dc2a0dd…) What a good time to be an open source contributor!

# Zeplin iOS

Say hello to first unofficial Zeplin companion app, Zeplin Client!
